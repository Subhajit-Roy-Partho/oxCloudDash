## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep indigo (#3F51B5) to evoke trust, security, and a sense of scientific rigor.
- Background color: A very light grey (#F0F2F5) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: A vibrant cyan (#00BCD4) to highlight interactive elements and key information.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, should be used for both body text and headings to maintain a clean, modern aesthetic.
- Use simple, clear, and professional icons from a consistent icon set (e.g., Material Design Icons) to represent actions, statuses, and data types.
- Employ a responsive, grid-based layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring optimal usability across platforms.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance the user experience, such as loading spinners, progress bars, and feedback animations on button clicks.
